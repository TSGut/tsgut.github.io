  I am a PhD student of applied mathematics at Imperial College London, with a background in mathematics, physics and philosophy. I am also an associated student of the doctoral program “Dissipation and Dispersion in Nonlinear PDEs” through the University of Vienna.

  My research focus is on numerical analysis and the development of computational tools for integral equations, PDEs and fractional differential equations with an eye on applications in the natural sciences.

          <img align="right" src="https://tsgut.github.io/images/a4-b145_no_gap.gif" width="200"/>Equilibrium measure problems appear, e.g. in the continuous mean-field limit of particle systems and thus have various applications ranging from the description of swarming and flocking behavior in animals and cells to self-assembly properties of particle systems.

        title: Spectral methods for integral equations
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <img align="right" src="https://tsgut.github.io/images/2ndkind-K2-1.png" width="200"/>Spectral methods are numerical methods which achieve exponential convergence through the use of appropriate approximation bases such as orthogonal polynomials. When set up correctly, one obtains banded sparse linear systems which can be solved with high efficiency. I have worked towards using such methods to solve linear and nonlinear integral and integro-differential equations which have applications in the natural sciences and finance.

        title: Splitting methods for relativistic Schrödinger-type equations
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <img align="right" src="https://tsgut.github.io/images/spinstates.gif" width="200"/>Relativistic variants of the Schrödinger equation such as the Pauli, Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations are used to model the behavior of particles moving at high velocities. When coupled to electromagnetic equations such as the Maxwell equations, these PDEs describing fermion and boson behavior are a challenge to solve numerically in the appropriate 3D context, even with benign assumptions on the potentials and boundaries. Lie and Strang splitting methods are a canonical approach to the numerical treatment of non-relativistic scalar Schrödinger equations - I have worked towards extending these methods to relativistic equations accounting for spin.

          <h2>Some open science projects I want to share</h2>
          - The <a href="https://oeis.org/" target="_blank">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> (OEIS) is brilliant and incredibly useful for exploratory work in numerical analysis. I have tried to give back to it when and where possible (e.g. <a href="https://oeis.org/A334588" target="_blank">A334588</a>) and hope you will consider doing so as well!
          - <a href="https://www.primegrid.com/"  target="_blank">PrimeGrid</a> is a BOINC-based volunteer distributed computing project which searches for prime numbers of various sizes and with various interesting properties. The largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primes_in_arithmetic_progression" target="_blank">AP-k</a> my computers have found so far has been <a href="https://www.primegrid.com/ap.php?userid=999250" target="_blank">my AP-27 of length 21</a> in 2018 - perhaps your devices will be luckier? 
          - I also share computing power with the BOINC-based distributed computing project <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/" target="_blank">Rosetta@home</a>, which works towards designing new proteins and predicting their 3-dimensional shapes, with potential biomedical applications.
